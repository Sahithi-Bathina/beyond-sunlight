# 🌊 Oceanus Vitae: Beyond Sunlight
### 🏆 Award: Best Global Connection | NASA Space Apps Challenge

## 📖 Project Overview
**Oceanus Vitae** (Latin for "Ocean of Life") is a technical and narrative simulation of **Abyssis**, a hypothetical aquatic world. In this environment, life thrives in total darkness, powered not by the sun, but by **chemosynthesis**.

This project explores the intersection of **Astrobiology** and **Software Engineering**, modeling how life adapts to extreme, high-pressure environments.

## 🧪 Scientific Logic: The Trophic Hierarchy
We engineered a 4-tier ecosystem based on chemical energy flow from hydrothermal vents:

| Role | Organism | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Producers** | Chemosynthetic Bacteria | Convert hydrogen sulfide into organic matter. |
| **Vent Grazers** | Vorgoths & Gulpers | Filter-feeders that consume bacterial mats. |
| **Chemovores** | Void Serpents | Nektonic hunters that track prey via chemical signatures. |
| **Predators** | Abyss Spiders | Ambush predators using bioluminescent lures. |
| **Decomposers** | Deeproot Worms | Recycle nutrients to maintain ecosystem health. |

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
The platform was built using a mix of modern web technologies and AI integration:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
* **AI Logic:** **ChatGPT** & **Blackbox AI** used for narrative architecture and energy flow simulation.
* **Multimedia:** Immersive video produced via **VN** and **CapCut**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Astrobiology Case Study:** Illustrates adaptation in environments drastically different from Earth.
* **Interactive Web Modules:** Explore Hydrothermal Vents and unique marine creatures.
* **Visual Storytelling:** A deep-dive video showcasing the "Abyssis" world.
