Oceanus Vitae: Beyond Sunlight 🌊🚀

Award: Best Global Connection | NASA Space Apps Challenge Team Name: Space_Explorers

Role: Team Lead (Sahithi Bathina)

🌟 Project Overview

Oceanus Vitae is a conceptual and technical exploration of Abyssis, a hypothetical aquatic world where life is sustained not by sunlight, but by chemosynthesis. Developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, this project translates complex astrobiological principles into a compelling visual and narrative experience.

    "Life thrives in darkness, fueled by the light of chemical reactions." 

🧪 Scientific Logic & Ecosystem

The ecosystem of Abyssis is modeled after hydrothermal vents, which release chemicals like hydrogen sulfide that microbes use to produce energy in the absence of sunlight.

The Trophic Hierarchy :

    Chemosynthetic Primary Producers: Bacteria and archaea that convert hydrogen sulfide and methane into organic matter, forming the base of the food chain.

    Vent Grazers (Herbivores): * Gulpers: Snail-like creatures that graze on bacterial mats.

        Vorgoths: Larger filter feeders that extract chemosynthetic bacteria from the water.

    Chemovores (Predators): * Void Serpents: Nektonic hunters that track prey using chemical signatures.

        Abyss Spiders: Ambush predators that use bioluminescent lures to attract prey.

    Decomposers: * Deeproot Worms: Organisms that break down organic matter to recycle nutrients and maintain ecosystem health.

💻 Tech Stack

    Frontend: Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create interactive webpages.

    AI Integration: Leveraged ChatGPT and Blackbox AI to architect complex narrative logic and biological simulations.

    Video Production: Directed an immersive visual showcase using VN and CapCut.

🛠️ Key Features

    Interactive Web Modules: Detailed sections on Hydrothermal Vents, Cold Seeps, and unique marine creatures .

    Ecosystem Dynamics Simulation: Models energy flow and nutrient cycling in extreme, high-pressure, and high-temperature environments.

    Astrobiology Case Study: Illustrates the potential for life to adapt and thrive in environments drastically different from Earth.
